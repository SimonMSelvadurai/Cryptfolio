## <h2 style="text-align:center" id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

This web app uses multiple server APIs as well as browser APIs to generate data and add functionality. It also utilises the Bulma CSS framework for styling and design.

This was a group exercise to develop and practice our skills in user-side web page design using HTML, Bulma CSS framework, CSS styling, javascript and API requests. 

Teamwork skills were a focus of the project using Github as a platform for multiuser development as well as project planning and execution.

This app is intended as a simple, single-page UI that allows a user to build a cryptocurrency portfolio for personal use. The app will generate current values for the stored cryptocurrency types in the users portfolio. The users portfolio will also be displayed as a graph that shows the relative values of each item within the portfolio as a whole.

Project
Given that I own, or intend to own, some digital currency:

As an investor in cryptocurrency I need to see the value of all my digital investments in one place so that I know what my portfolio is worth.

As a user I want to be able to see a clear and easy to navigate landing page so that I am motivated and able to easily navigate and explore the app.

As a user I want to easily find basic currency information so that I can initiate or build my digital portfolio.

As a user I want to be able to access links for further information so that I can be more informed.

As a user I want to be able to add amounts of a selected crypto to my display, so that I can view my total potential holdings and worth to make strategies.

As a user I want to see a visual representation (graphs) of my portfolio so that I can easily understand its composition and value of the elements.

As a user I want to be able to have some sort of rewards system so that I can have fun whilst using the app.

As a user I want to be able to visualize what my portfolio worth could purchase in the real world so that I can get a sense of the tangible nature of its worth.

As a user I want to be able to store my portfolio for use at a further time so that I don't have to keep re-entering my selections.

As a user I want to be able to update and adjust my portfolio to keep up with changes so that I am able to invest wisely and in a timely manner.
